  ## Group structure

  This uses “[...] the [X-team strategy](http://mitsloan.mit.edu/newsroom/newsbriefs-0605-ancona.php) advocated by MIT professor Deborah Ancona, who defines three tiers of team members: core, operational, and outer. The core consists of executives responsible for strategy. The operational group leads and makes decisions about day-to-day work but doesn’t tackle the larger issues handled by the core. And the outer network consists of temporary or part-time members who are brought in for a particular stage of the project because of their specialized expertise. (From: [hbr.org - Getting Virtual Teams Right](https://hbr.org/2014/12/getting-virtual-teams-right))
  * Core:  Security management and leads
  * Operational:  Security team members
  * Outer:  Consultants

  The groups, and the department as a whole, will be virtual where the members will be geographically separate.  While teleworkers are permitted, those assigned to a location are expected to operate from that location.  A weekly AWA (Alternate Work Arrangement) day working from home however may be arranged.

  Each group will be led by a Team Lead (or Manager if needed), limited to 4-5 employees including the manager/lead, and a maximum of 10 people with consultants. (From: [hbr.org - Getting Virtual Teams Right](https://hbr.org/2014/12/getting-virtual-teams-right))

  Consultants are limited to 6 month contracts for no more than 18 months max after which there must be a minimum of 6 months before the contract can be renewed.
