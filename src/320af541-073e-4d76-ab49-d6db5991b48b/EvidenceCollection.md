# Collection of evidence


Where a follow-up action against a person or organization after an information security incident involves legal action (either civil or criminal), evidence should be collected, retained, and presented to conform to the rules for evidence laid down in the relevant jurisdiction(s).

Internal procedures should be developed and followed when collecting and presenting evidence for the purposes of disciplinary action handled within an organization.

In general, the rules for evidence cover:
a) admissibility of evidence: whether or not the evidence can be used in court;
b) weight of evidence: the quality and completeness of the evidence.

To achieve admissibility of the evidence, the organization should ensure that their information systems comply with any published standard or code of practice for the production of admissible evidence.

The weight of evidence provided should comply with any applicable requirements. To achieve weight of evidence, the quality and completeness of the controls used to correctly and consistently protect the evidence (i.e. process control evidence) throughout the period that the evidence to be recovered was stored and processed should be demonstrated by a strong evidence trail. In general, such a strong trail can be established under the following conditions:
a) for paper documents: the original is kept securely with a record of the individual who found the document, where the document was found, when the document was found and who witnessed the discovery; any investigation should ensure that originals are not tampered with;
b) for information on computer media: mirror images or copies (depending on applicable requirements) of any removable media, information on hard disks or in memory should be taken to ensure availability; the log of all actions during the copying process should be kept and the process should be witnessed; the original media and the log (if this is not possible, at least one mirror image or copy) should be kept securely and untouched.

Any forensics work should only be performed on copies of the evidential material. The integrity of all evidential material should be protected. Copying of evidential material should be supervised by trustworthy personnel and information on when and where the copying process was executed, who performed the copying activities and which tools and programs have been utilized should be logged.

When an information security event is first detected, it may not be obvious whether or not the event will result in court action. Therefore, the danger exists that necessary evidence is destroyed intentionally or accidentally before the seriousness of the incident is realized. It is advisable to involve a lawyer or the police early in any contemplated legal action and take advice on the evidence required.

Evidence may transcend organizational and/or jurisdictional boundaries. In such cases, it should be ensured that the organization is entitled to collect the required information as evidence. The requirements of different jurisdictions should also be considered to maximize chances of admission across the relevant jurisdictions.
