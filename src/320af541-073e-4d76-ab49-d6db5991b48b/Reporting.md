2.3.4 Sharing Information With Outside Parties
Organizations often need to communicate with outside parties regarding an incident, and they should do
so whenever appropriate, such as contacting law enforcement, fielding media inquiries, and seeking
external expertise. Another example is discussing incidents with other involved parties, such as Internet
service providers (ISPs), the vendor of vulnerable software, or other incident response teams.
Organizations may also proactively share relevant incident indicator information with peers to improve
detection and analysis of incidents. The incident response team should discuss information sharing with
the organizationâ€™s public affairs office, legal department, and management before an incident occurs to
establish policies and procedures regarding information sharing. Otherwise, sensitive information
regarding incidents may be provided to unauthorized parties, potentially leading to additional disruption
and financial loss. The team should document all contacts and communications with outside parties for
liability and evidentiary purposes.
The following sections provide guidelines on communicating with several types of outside parties, as
depicted in Figure 2-1. The double-headed arrows indicate that either party may initiate communications.
See Section 4 for additional information on communicating with outside parties, and see Section 2.4 for a
discussion of communications involving incident response outsourcers.
