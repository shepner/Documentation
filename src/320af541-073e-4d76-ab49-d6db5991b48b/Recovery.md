# Recovery

action to recover from security breaches and correct system failures should be carefully and formally controlled; the procedures should ensure that:

* only clearly identified and authorized personnel are allowed access to live systems and data (see also 6.2 for external access);
* all emergency actions taken are documented in detail;
* emergency action is reported to management and reviewed in an orderly manner;
* the integrity of business systems and controls is confirmed with minimal delay.
