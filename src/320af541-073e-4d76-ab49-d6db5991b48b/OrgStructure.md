# Organizational structure and responsibilities

The Security Incident Management group reports to the Manager of Cyber Security.

The groupâ€™s lead is the primary conduit for day-to-day operational and escalation needs.

Members of the group will maintain an on-call rotation to obtain 24/7/365 coverage

Appropriate training will be provided to group members for how to respond to security breaches.  Group members are additionally expected to continually seek out training on their own.

The group will follow a centralized model<sup><a id="Organizational_structure_and_responsibilities-ref1-src" href="#Organizational_structure_and_responsibilities-ref1">[1]</a></sup> but the members may be geographically disperse.

Staffing will be pridominately follow a partially outsourced model.<sup><a id="Organizational_structure_and_responsibilities-ref2-src" href="#Organizational_structure_and_responsibilities-ref2">[2]</a></sup>
Consultants are to be used for the first level screening of incoming information without access to sensitive information.
