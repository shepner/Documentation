# Learning from information security incidents

There should be mechanisms in place to enable the types, volumes, and costs of information security incidents to be quantified and monitored.

The information gained from the evaluation of information security incidents should be used to identify recurring or high impact incidents.

The evaluation of information security incidents may indicate the need for enhanced or additional controls to limit the frequency, damage, and cost of future occurrences, or to be taken into account in the security policy review process (see 5.1.2).
