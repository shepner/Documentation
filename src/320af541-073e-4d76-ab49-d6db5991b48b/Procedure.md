# Procedure

Group team members are to monitor systems, alerts, and vulnerabilities to detect security incidents.


procedures should be established to handle different types of information security incident, including:

* information system failures and loss of service;
* malicious code (see 10.4.1);<sup><a id="Procedure-ref1-src" href="#Procedure-ref1">[1]</a></sup>
* denial of service;
* errors resulting from incomplete or inaccurate business data;
* breaches of confidentiality and integrity;
* misuse of information systems;

in addition to normal contingency plans (see 14.1.3), the procedures should also cover (see also 13.2.2):

* analysis and identification of the cause of the incident;
* containment;
* planning and implementation of corrective action to prevent recurrence, if necessary;
* communication with those affected by or involved with recovery from the incident;
* reporting the action to the appropriate authority;

audit trails and similar evidence should be collected (see 13.2.3) and secured, as appropriate, for:

* internal problem analysis;
* use as forensic evidence in relation to a potential breach of contract or regulatory requirement or in the event of civil or criminal proceedings, e.g. under computer misuse or data protection legislation;
* negotiating for compensation from software and service suppliers;



NIST 2.3.3
Procedures should be based on the incident response policy and plan. Standard operating procedures (SOPs) are a delineation of the specific technical processes, techniques, checklists, and forms used by the incident response team. SOPs should be reasonably comprehensive and detailed to ensure that the 

priorities of the organization are reflected in response operations. In addition, following standardized responses should minimize errors, particularly those that might be caused by stressful incident handling situations. SOPs should be tested to validate their accuracy and usefulness, then distributed to all team members. Training should be provided for SOP users; the SOP documents can be used as an instructional tool. Suggested SOP elements are presented throughout Section 3.
