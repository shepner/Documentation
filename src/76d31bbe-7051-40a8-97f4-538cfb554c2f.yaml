  # PCI DSS Requirements
  
  **12.10.5** Include alerts from security monitoring systems, including but not limited to intrusion-detection, intrusion-prevention, firewalls, and file-integrity monitoring systems.
  
  # Testing Procedures
  
  **12.10.5** Verify through observation and review of processes that monitoring and responding to alerts from security monitoring systems are covered in the incident response plan.
  
  # Guidance
  
  These monitoring systems are designed to focus on potential risk to data, are critical in taking quick action to prevent a breach, and must be included in the incident-response processes.
