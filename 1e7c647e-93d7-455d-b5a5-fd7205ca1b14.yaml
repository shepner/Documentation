  ## PCI DSS Requirements
  
  **1.1.2** Current network diagram that identifies all connections between the cardholder data environment and other networks, including any wireless networks

  ## Testing Procedures
  
  **1.1.2.a** Examine diagram(s) and observe network configurations to verify that a current network diagram exists and that it documents all connections to cardholder data, including any wireless networks.
  
  **1.1.2.b** Interview responsible personnel to verify that the diagram is kept current.

  ## Guidance
  
  Network diagrams describe how networks are configured, and identify the location of all network devices.

  Without current network diagrams, devices could be overlooked and be unknowingly left out of the security controls implemented for PCI DSS and thus be vulnerable to compromise.
