Documentation management
========================

The purpose of this is to determine how the documentation will be
managed. Security Policy, Standards, Controls, Requirements, etc, etc,
etc represent a huge body of text. All of which needs to be managed,
maintained, cross referenced, etc.

This document is the template for how this will be performed using plain
ASCII text files, structured using YAML, and formatted with Markdown.

Ideally, all documentation would use this methodology at its core

There are multiple advantages to this approach: No vendor lock-in: In
particular, everything is stored in a simple easy to understand human
readable format which can be implemented with a number of cheap or free
solutions. All documentation is data: While that technically has always
been the case, the use of YAML enforces that. Compiling documentation:
Much like compiling code, this permits interacting with the
documentation in interesting ways such as having a simple script which
can pull out all of the relevant standards, provide references to *why*
they are there (ie link back to the audit finding, regulatory control,
etc) and output the whole thing in whatever format (PDF, spreadsheet,
etc) the customer finds useful.

Storage
-------

All files will be stored in a single github repo. This will provide the
needed revision history. This also permits branch control. Also, each
file has a unique URL which will greatly aid in further unforseen
possibilities.

File naming
-----------

Ideally, the name of the file would be the contents of the ID field. As
these are YAML spec files, the extension `.yaml` is to be used. In the
event the mechanism storing the files does not have revision control,
the full filename would be `<ID>_<Revision Date>.yaml`.

Publishing
----------

It should be noted that this naming scheme is absolutely unhelpful for
the human who wants to do anything with the files. To solve this
problem, a table of contents is to be generated whenever there is a
change to the body of information.

When using a repository tool with the concept of branches, it would be
possible to create an “official policy branch” or the like. If this is
not available, or if it proves too difficult, this would have to be
controlled by YAML config files to handle these groupings.

The YAML config files are also needed for the output to have a sensible
order. Without this, the resulting document will have all of the
relevant data but randomly dispersed throughout with no logical order in
that section. This could be done by explicitly setting the order (ie
File A first, File C second, File B third) but ideally, this order would
be managed automatically by the information contained within the files
themselves.

File format
-----------

This is how the files would be formatted. Fields may be removed if not
needed.

Evaluation of the file starts with parsing the YAML followed by parsing
the CommonMark (Markdown) within the values.

See the [source]() of this file for the layout [YAML
Standard](https://yaml.org/) [CommonMark](https://commonmark.org/help/)
(Markdown) [specification](https://spec.commonmark.org/current/): There
are many specs ([Wikipedia
discussion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown)) but this is closest
to a standard [lipsum.com - Lorem Ipsum generator](https://lipsum.com/)

This is an example of how the files could be organized via a config file
when it is not practical or desired to let the documents self-organize.

    %YAML 1.2
    ---
    document:
      title: "Access Control Standard"
      contents:
        # Think table of contents.  Note that
        # The contents, when listed, fix the order of the referenced documents.
        # Otherwise, they will just be added together randomly.
        - “ba270852-d31b-4abf-9984-2a8a2d22e12f”
        - “0cdb8583-8b88-47e3-af04-11c05f1ef7f5”

    ...
    %YAML 1.2
    ---
    document:
      title: "All the Security Policies and Standards"
      contents: # list the Policy documents before the Standard documents
        # this is also perfectly fine (provided the YAML is correct)
        type: Policy  #want fixed order output
          - “52d05e9f-2af9-4a5d-8d9f-0ba5e9158c30”
          - “f0201539-7594-4f71-894f-6b20ab7725b6”
          - “987b4050-f867-4624-ad1f-8cb32d6fb531”
          - “589ccbb2-b074-4773-909e-10be26aef46b”
        type: Standard  # dont care about the order of the output for this section
    ...
