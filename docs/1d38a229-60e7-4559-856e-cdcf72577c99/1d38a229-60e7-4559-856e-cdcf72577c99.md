PCI DSS Requirements
====================

**12.10.4** Provide appropriate training to staff with security breach
response responsibilities.

Testing Procedures
==================

**12.10.4** Verify through observation, review of policies, and
interviews of responsible personnel that staff with responsibilities for
security breach response are periodically trained.

Guidance
========

Without a trained and readily available incident response team, extended
damage to the network could occur, and critical data and systems may
become “polluted” by inappropriate handling of the targeted systems.
This can hinder the success of a post-incident investigation.
