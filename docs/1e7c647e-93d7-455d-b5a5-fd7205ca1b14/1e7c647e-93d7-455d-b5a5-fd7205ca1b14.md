PCI DSS Requirements
--------------------

**1.1.2** Current network diagram that identifies all connections
between the cardholder data environment and other networks, including
any wireless networks

Testing Procedures
------------------

**1.1.2.a** Examine diagram(s) and observe network configurations to
verify that a current network diagram exists and that it documents all
connections to cardholder data, including any wireless networks.

**1.1.2.b** Interview responsible personnel to verify that the diagram
is kept current.

Guidance
--------

Network diagrams describe how networks are configured, and identify the
location of all network devices.

Without current network diagrams, devices could be overlooked and be
unknowingly left out of the security controls implemented for PCI DSS
and thus be vulnerable to compromise.
