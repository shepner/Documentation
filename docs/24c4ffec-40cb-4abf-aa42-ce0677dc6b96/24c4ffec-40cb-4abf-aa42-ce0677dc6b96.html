<h1 id="guidance">Guidance</h1>
<p><em><strong>Note</strong>: This requirement applies only when the entity being assessed is a service provider.</em></p>
<p>Regularly confirming that security policies and procedures are being followed provides assurance that the expected controls are active and working as intended. The objective of these reviews is not to re-perform other PCI DSS requirements, but to confirm whether procedures are being followed as expected.</p>
