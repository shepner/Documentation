PCI DSS Requirements
====================

**12.10.3** Designate specific personnel to be available on a 24/7 basis
to respond to alerts.

Testing Procedures
==================

**12.10.3** Verify through observation, review of policies, and
interviews of responsible personnel that designated personnel are
available for 24/7 incident response and monitoring coverage for any
evidence of unauthorized activity, detection of unauthorized wireless
access points, critical IDS alerts, and/or reports of unauthorized
critical system or content file changes.

Guidance
========

Without a trained and readily available incident response team, extended
damage to the network could occur, and critical data and systems may
become “polluted” by inappropriate handling of the targeted systems.
This can hinder the success of a post-incident investigation.
